# Project Overview
1. Introduction

This is a final project for the MSCIT course 'Technical Writing and Entrepreneurship Development' at the PILLAI COLLEGE OF ARTS, COMMERCE, AND SCIENCE. The 'Musicbox' project aims to provide users with a variety of features related to audio interaction. This project's utilities include playing music, utilizing a voice recorder, and playing different musical instruments like as the piano and drum-kit.

2. Technologies Used

In this project, the following technologies have been made use of -

* HTML 5 : HTML 5 has been used for laying down the structure of this project.
* CSS 3 : CSS 3 has been used to add styling & provide responsiveness to this project.
* JavaScript : JavaScript has been used to add interactivity with the WebAudio API & implementation of all the other vital functionalities.

3. Core Functionalities

This project is aimed at providing 3 core functionalities, which are as following -

* Selecting & playing music from a list of songs.
* Audio recording, playback & downloading options.
* Playing musical instruments like piano & drumkit.

=>  Music Playlist : When a visitor initially visits a website, this capability allows him to select and play a music from a list. Aside from that, there is a fixed music player at the bottom of the page, which allows the user to have audio controls throughout the page, such as playing/pausing, stop, muting/unmuting, and playing previous/next song. 

=>  Voice Recorder : This feature allows the user to record his own vocals, pause them whenever he wants, and then play back anything he has recorded. Furthermore, the user can download his newly recorded music, which will allow him to preserve his recordings locally.
=>  Musical Instruments : This feature allows the user to choose between two musical instruments to perform, namely the piano and the drumkit. The user may enjoy playing a 17-key piano with the click of his mouse. The drumkit, on the other hand, allows you to play using both the mouse and the keyboard.

4. Extras

The following features have also been implemented into the project, in addition to the installation of audio functionalities:

* Implementing gloomy, visually appealing pictures into the project will help it grab the user's attention right away.
*Adding a few animations and.gif files gives the project a more flexible environment.
* implementation of event-based styles, such as "click" and "hover," which can improve the user experience.
* The project has been developed with minimal responsiveness so that the user may access it from his personal tablet, or smartphone. & Computer as well.
*The use of royalty-free music helps the project avoid copyright problems.
* Implementation of click-based scrolling has been done such that, on clicking on any section in Navbar, the page would be scrolled down to the appropriate section. Also, there's a button on the bottom right side of the page, that can take the user to the top of the page whenever it is clicked. This can help in enhancing the navigation experience of the user.

5. Performance

A major part of any utility based website is its performance. If the pages takes too much time to load, it may annoy the user & ultimately, the user may leave the website without even checking the utilities provided. Therefore, the basic performance of this project has been taken into due consideration. 

Here are the performance indicators before the project was optimized -

As the metrics indicate, the projects had a fair performance.
Here are the performance indicators after the project has been optimized -

As per the metrics, the performance of the project jumped 27 points, which is evident from the reduced page loading time as well. For the performance test, Google Chrome's Lighthouse has been used in this project.
